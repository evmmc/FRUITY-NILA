# FRUITY NILA  
*Fruity Native Instruments Language Agent — MIDI Script for FL Studio*

**Author: sound**

**FRUITY NILA** is a powerful MIDI script designed to bring Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol keyboards to life in FL Studio. It provides advanced DAW integration for the [M-Series](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/keyboards/komplete-kontrol-m32/), [A-Series](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/keyboards/komplete-kontrol-a25-a49-a61), and [S-Series](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/keyboards/komplete-kontrol-s88/).

Powered by Native Instruments’ Host Integration protocol, FRUITY NILA delivers a seamless controller experience—similar to what you’d expect in Ableton or Logic Pro X—without interfering with the Komplete Kontrol app or plugin.
